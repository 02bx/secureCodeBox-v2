**NOTE**: This Repository contains a **work in progress** preview of the planned next mayor secureCodeBox Release. You can find the current **stable release** here [https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox). The release of version 2.0 is still at least some month away but you can already get a sneak peak here ðŸ˜€. The release will contain a mayor re architecture of the secureCodeBox. More details will follow soon in a series of blog articles.

> _secureCodeBox_ is a kubernetes based, modularized toolchain for continuous security scans of your software project. Its goal is to orchestrate and easily automate a bunch of security-testing tools out of the box.

## Purpose of this Project

The typical way to ensure application security is to hire a security specialist (aka penetration tester) at some point in your project to check the application for security bugs and vulnerabilities. Usually, this check is done at a later stage of the project and has two major drawbacks:

1. Nowadays, a lot of projects do continuous delivery, which means the developers deploy new versions multiple times each day. The penetration tester is only able to check a single snapshot, but some further commits could introduce new security issues. To ensure ongoing application security, the penetration tester should also continuously test the application. Unfortunately, such an approach is rarely financially feasible.
2. Due to a typically time boxed analysis, the penetration tester has to focus on trivial security issues (low-hangig fruits) and therefore will not address the serious, non-obvious ones.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The purpose of _secureCodeBox_ **is not** to replace the penetration testers or make them obsolete. We strongly recommend to run extensive tests by experienced penetration testers on all your applications.

**Important note**: The _secureCodeBox_ is no simple one-button-click-solution! You must have a deep understanding of security and how to configure the scanners. Furthermore, an understanding of the scan results and how to interpret them is also necessary.

There is a german article about [Security DevOps â€“ Angreifern (immer) einen Schritt voraus][secdevops-objspec] in the software engineering journal [OBJEKTSpektrum][objspec].

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- kubernetes

### Deployment

```bash
# This is currently under development. Before a proper release the operator will be packaged up as a helm chart.

# You'll need to configure a s3 or compatible file storage (https://min.io recommended when self hosting)
# E.g. for digitalocean (the credentials are fake ðŸ˜‰)
export S3_ENDPOINT="fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com"
export S3_ACCESS_KEY="HASJHVDJAVJDSVAISWNA"
export S3_SECRET_KEY="ffi+cfkntT9AHTwKFarvywKvG6YstxaNUsfuh!nqTUh"
export S3_BUCKET="securecodebox"
# Install Custom Resource Definitions
make install

# Run Operator locally (against current kubectl context)
make run

# Elasticsearch Persistence Provider Deployment
helm install persistence-elastic ./persistence/persistence-elastic/

# Deploy nmap, amass and ssh_scan ScanJob and ParseJob Definition
kubectl apply -f integrations/nmap/nmap-scanjob-definition.yaml -f integrations/nmap/nmap-parsejob-definition.yaml
kubectl apply -f integrations/amass/amass-scanjob-definition.yaml -f integrations/amass/amass-parsejob-definition.yaml
kubectl apply -f integrations/ssh_scan/ssh-scan-scanjob-definition.yaml -f integrations/ssh_scan/ssh-scan-parsejob-definition.yaml
```
