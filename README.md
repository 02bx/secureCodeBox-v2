**NOTE**: This Repository contains a **work in progress** preview of the planned next major secureCodeBox Release. You can find the current **stable release** here [https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox). The release of version 2.0 is still at least some month away but you can already get a sneak peak here ðŸ˜€. The release will contain a major architecture change which will not be backward compatible. More details will follow soon in a series of blog articles.

> _secureCodeBox_ is a kubernetes based, modularized toolchain for continuous security scans of your software project. Its goal is to orchestrate and easily automate a bunch of security-testing tools out of the box.

## Purpose of this Project

The typical way to ensure application security is to hire a security specialist (aka penetration tester) at some point in your project to check the application for security bugs and vulnerabilities. Usually, this check is done at a later stage of the project and has two major drawbacks:

1. Nowadays, a lot of projects do continuous delivery, which means the developers deploy new versions multiple times each day. The penetration tester is only able to check a single snapshot, but some further commits could introduce new security issues. To ensure ongoing application security, the penetration tester should also continuously test the application. Unfortunately, such an approach is rarely financially feasible.
2. Due to a typically time boxed analysis, the penetration tester has to focus on trivial security issues (low-hanging fruits) and therefore will not address the serious, non-obvious ones.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The purpose of _secureCodeBox_ **is not** to replace the penetration testers or make them obsolete. We strongly recommend to run extensive tests by experienced penetration testers on all your applications.

**Important note**: The _secureCodeBox_ is no simple one-button-click-solution! You must have a deep understanding of security and how to configure the scanners. Furthermore, an understanding of the scan results and how to interpret them is also necessary.

There is a german article about [Security DevOps â€“ Angreifern (immer) einen Schritt voraus][secdevops-objspec] in the software engineering journal [OBJEKTSpektrum][objspec].

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- kubernetes (last 4 major releases supported: `1.15`, `1.16`, `1.17` & `1.18`)

### Deployment (based on Helm)

Deploy the secureCodeBox operator first:

```bash
kubectl create namespace securecodebox-system
helm -n securecodebox-system install securecodebox-operator ./operator/
```

Optionally deploy SCB scanner Charts for each security scanner you want to use:

```bash
helm upgrade --install amass ./scanners/amass/
helm upgrade --install kube-hunter ./scanners/kube-hunter/
helm upgrade --install nikto ./scanners/nikto
helm upgrade --install nmap ./scanners/nmap/
helm upgrade --install ssh-scan ./scanners/ssh_scan/
helm upgrade --install sslyze ./scanners/sslyze/
helm upgrade --install trivy ./scanners/trivy/
helm upgrade --install zap ./scanners/zap/
helm upgrade --install wpscan ./scanners/wpscan/
```

Optional deploy some demo apps for scanning:

```bash
helm upgrade --install dummy-ssh ./demo-apps/dummy-ssh/
```

Deploy secureCodeBox Hooks:

```bash
helm upgrade --install aah ./hooks/update-field/
helm upgrade --install gwh ./hooks/generic-webhook/
helm upgrade --install issh ./hooks/imperative-subsequent-scans/
```

Persistence provider Elasticsearch:

```bash
helm upgrade --install elkh ./hooks/persistence-elastic/
```

### Examples

Now everything is installed. You can try deploying scans from the `scanners/*/examples` directories.

#### Local Scan Examples

E.g. localhost nmap scan:

```bash
kubectl apply -f scanners/nmap/examples/localhost/scan.yaml
```

#### Public Scan Examples

```bash
kubectl apply -f scanners/nmap/examples/scan.nmap.org/scan.yaml
```

#### Then get the current State of the Scan by running:

```bash
kubectl get scans
```

### Access Services

- Minio UI:
  - AccessKey: `kubectl get secret securecodebox-operator-minio -n securecodebox-system -o=jsonpath='{.data.accesskey}' | base64 --decode; echo`
  - SecretKey: `kubectl get secret securecodebox-operator-minio -n securecodebox-system -o=jsonpath='{.data.secretkey}' | base64 --decode; echo`
  - Port Forward Minio UI: `kubectl port-forward -n securecodebox-system service/securecodebox-operator-minio 9000:9000`
- Elastic / Kibana UI:
  - User: `elastic`
  - Password: `kubectl get secret scb-elasticsearch-es-elastic-user -n scb-analytics -o=jsonpath='{.data.elastic}' | base64 --decode; echo`
  - Port Forward Kibana: `kubectl port-forward -n default service/persistence-elastic-kibana 5601:5601`
  - Port Forward Elasticsearch: `kubectl port-forward -n default service/elasticsearch-master 9200:9200`
